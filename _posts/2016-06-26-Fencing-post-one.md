### This is a nice title

The modern épée (English pronunciation: /ˈɛpeɪ/ or /ˈeɪpeɪ/, French pronunciation: ​[epe]) derives from the 19th century Épée de Combat,[1] (itself a derivative of the French small-sword), and is the largest and heaviest of the three weapons used in sport fencing. Épée is French for "sword".

As a thrusting weapon the épée is similar to a foil (compared to a sabre), but has a stiffer blade which is triangular in cross-section with a V-shaped groove called a fuller, has a larger bell guard, and is heavier. The technique however, is somewhat different, as there are no rules regarding priority and right of way. In addition, the entire body is a valid target area.
